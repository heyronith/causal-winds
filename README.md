# 🌬️ Causal Winds

*Predicting flight cancellations and attributing them to specific causes using causal inference methods.*

A machine learning project that goes beyond correlation to identify the true causal relationships behind flight cancellations.

## Problem Statement

Most flight cancellation models only predict *if* a flight will be cancelled, but don't explain *why*. This project goes beyond correlation to identify causal relationships, answering:

- **What actually causes cancellations?** (not just what correlates)
- **How much does each factor contribute?** (weather vs. operations vs. other)
- **What can be done about it?** (intervention recommendations)

## Key Features

- **Prediction**: Forecast flight cancellations with high accuracy
- **Attribution**: Identify specific causes (weather, mechanical, crew, etc.)
- **Causal Analysis**: Quantify true causal effects, not just correlations
- **Intervention Insights**: Understand what actions prevent cancellations

## Technical Approach

1. **Baseline Models**: XGBoost, time series transformers
2. **Causal Inference**: Difference-in-differences, propensity score matching
3. **Attribution**: Shapley values, counterfactual analysis
4. **Evaluation**: Prediction accuracy + attribution accuracy
